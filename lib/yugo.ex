  Subscribes the calling process to the [`Client`](`Yugo.Client`) named by `client_name`.

  When you subscribe to a client, your process will be notified about new emails via a message
  in the form `{:email, client, message}`, where `client` is the name of the client that is notifying you,
  and `message` is the email. See the [`email`](`t:Yugo.email/0`) type for the structure of the `message` field.

  emails you want to be notified about. If you do not pass a filter, it defaults to [`Filter.all`](`Yugo.Filter.all/0`),
